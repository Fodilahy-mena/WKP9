Hey team!
After a major graded project, let's do something different, and a little bit more straightforward.
Today weâ€™re going to build a list of the Studio Ghibli Movies, ranked from best to worst. If you havenâ€™t seen any of those, I suggest you to look on the Onja hard drive! (after completing the project of course). They are amazing âœ¨

The website will look similar to this :

![assets/ghibli.png](assets/ghibli.png)

You will fetch the data from this URL [https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films)

and display the result in the HTML. The film needs to be sorted depending on their rt_score!

There is a lot of data in a film object, use whatever attribute you need.

Feel free to add some beautiful styling to your website when you're done fetching and sorting the data.

Good luck ðŸ’»

### Report

1. The structure of the project.

    - To make the data from Studio Ghibli Movies url more accessible, I used fetch(). I used a catch method in case there is an error intead of fulfilling the promise.  
    - I used async await function so that it is loading until the prossess of uploading the data from the url is done.
    
2. If you had more time, what area of your project would you improve?
 
3. Did you learn anything new while working on this project?

4. What was the most challenging part for you?


5. Any other comments?
